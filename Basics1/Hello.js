console.log("Hello")


prompt("Enter your name") // it will prompt the user to enter the name
// The prompt function is not inherently an error, but there are a few reasons why it might not work as expected in certain environments:

// Not Supported in Node.js: The prompt function is a part of the Web API and is available in web browsers. It is not available in Node.js, which is a server-side runtime environment. If you are running this code in Node.js, you will get an error because prompt is not defined.
