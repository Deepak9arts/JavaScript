//The difference in output when using Number and new Number in JavaScript is due to the distinction between primitive values and objects.
// Here, balance is an instance of the Number object.
// When you use new Number(1000), it creates a Number object that wraps the primitive value 1000.
// When you log balance to the console, it outputs the Number object: [Number: 1000].
