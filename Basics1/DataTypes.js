//null is a standalone  value ( but not 0 beacuse ) itself is a value

// The datatype of null is object 


//undefined means varibale  does not have a value assigned to it
//hence no  data type can be determined for undefined

//undefined is a type in itself


console.log(typeof null); //object

console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined



/** === operator */

console.log(2==="2") //false

//it performs strict checks i.e it checks the data type as well
