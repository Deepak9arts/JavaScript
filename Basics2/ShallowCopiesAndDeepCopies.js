//Shallow copies modify the original object when they are changed
//Deep copies do not modify the original object when they are changed

//it means shallow copy is just a reference to the original object and any change in shallow copy will reflect in original object as well
//but in case of deep copy, any change in deep copy will not reflect in original object
